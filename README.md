# Ferrero Rocher Clone

This is a simple Ferrero Rocher clone built using React. The project mimics the product page of Ferrero Rocher with details, images, and an interactive UI. It's designed to demonstrate basic React concepts like components, state, props, and event handling.

## Features

- Product image display
- Detailed product information (name, description, price)
- Add to cart functionality
- Responsive design
- Basic styling to mimic the look and feel of Ferrero Rocher's official website

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **React Hooks**: For managing state and side-effects
- **CSS**: For styling the components
- **React Router** (Optional): If you choose to add routing for multiple pages
